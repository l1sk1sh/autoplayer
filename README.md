# autoplayer-coh2
This script is intended to automate farming of the loot points in the Company of Heroes 2.
As imagined, it will be written using **Python 3** and **PyAutoGUI** library.
To gain maximum profit match should be exactly 5-6 minutes, without mods and on licensed maps.
Otherwise, there is a limitation of 240000 points and respectively 4 loot boxes (that takes ~1 hour).

As of now, bot is working only with modded scenario (that requires CheatCommands 2 mod from Steam Workshop), only on one map, and with any faction.

### Make sure that...
'python' in system's path is actually Python 3.7+ with install pip module
