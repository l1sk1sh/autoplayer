# autoplayer-coh2
This script is intended to automate farming of the loot points in the Company of Heroes 2.
As imagined, it will be written using **Python 3** and **PyAutoGUI** library.
To gain maximum profit match should be exactly 5-6 minutes, without mods and on licensed maps.
Otherwise, there is a limitation of 240000 points and respectively 4 loot boxes (that takes ~1 hour).

#### Two possible execution scenarios
##### Modded "sudden death"
- Easy AI on the 1vs1 map
- Do nothing and wait for 5 minutes
- Launch CheatCommands 2 and remove AI's base (or use annihilation setup)
- Repeat
##### Unmodded "hard play"
- Easy AI on the 1vs1 map
- Activate Cheat Engine and set unlimited resources
- Set rally point at the enamy base
- Spam infantry and anti-tank
- Time should be carefully calculated, as it might be possible to win sooner
- Repeat
